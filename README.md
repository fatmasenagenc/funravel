# Funravel

Unravel, travel and have fun!

Planning a trip for an event outside your city can be time-consuming and hard. Funravel wants to optimise this planning time spent, by suggesting to users a travel plan for an event and calculating the total cost of their travel, including accommodation and transportation. Essentially, Funravel is an event-based travel optimization mobile application. Funravel also aims to connect users with each other who do not want to attend these events all by themselves. Overall, it wants to reduce time spent on the planning of far-away events as much as possible with the possibility of group planning.
