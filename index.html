<p>Unravel, travel, and have fun!</p>
<p>Planning a trip for an event outside your city can be really time consuming and hard. Funravel is a mobile app which suggests users events and calculates total cost of their events which is further away from where they live. The app redirects users to the booking websites after generating a travel plan for the event. Users can give information about their favorite events, favorite singers etc. The application would give notifications about incoming events they would like. Users can create posts about their travels and activities to share them with other users. To finance the application, in-app advertisements and booking, ticket website commissions are used.</p>
