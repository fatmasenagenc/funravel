<p>Unravel, travel, and have fun!</p>
<p>Planning a trip for yourself can be really time consuming and hard. Funravel is a mobile app which suggests a travel plan randomly, according to preferences or past experiences of users. The apllication redirects user to the booking websites after generating a travel plan. Users can rate their suggested travels and mark them as "will go" / "won't go". They can also create posts about their travels and activities to share them with fellow travel enthusiasts. The financing for the application is done by in-app advertisements and booking websites commissions.</p>
